# IO Speed Monitor

A simple Python program to monitor disk I/O speed and take actions based on the detected speed.

## Description

This program uses the `psutil` library to monitor the write speed of the disk. If the write speed exceeds a specified threshold, the program terminates itself immediately. The program also generates sequences and saves them to a file.

## Features

- Monitors disk I/O speed
- Generates sequences and saves them to a file
- Provides logging for better visibility

## Usage

1. Install the required Python library:

   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

   **Note:** The program cannot be interrupted using Ctrl+C.

## Configuration

Adjust the following parameters in the script according to your requirements:

- `start`: Starting character for sequence generation.
- `target`: Ending character for sequence generation.
- `num_characters`: Number of characters in each sequence.
- `file_name`: Name of the file to save generated sequences.
- `threshold_write_speed`: Threshold for high disk write speed.

## Logging

The program logs important events to both the console and a file named `script.log`.

## Warning

The program cannot be interrupted using Ctrl+C. It terminates immediately when high disk I/O speed is detected.
